# lowpass-filter

Simple first-order digital lowpass filters, compatible with `no_std`. You can
use it, for example, to get the low frequencies from a song.

## Difference to `biquad`

**âš  TL;DR: `biquad` might be a better option in some use-cases.**

This crate provides a basic and simple to understand, first order lowpass
filter. The [biquad](https://crates.io/crates/biquad) crate offers second order
filters, with higher accuracy. From my testing, a lowpass filter created with
`biquad` has higher computational costs as this crate, but offers a
**better resolution for actually cutting of signals above the cut-off frequency
while the preserved signal will be less attenuated**.

So for production use-cases, please also consider using `biquad`. You can run
benchmark and check your data (e.g., by plotting) to make that decision.

## Usage

You can either use the `LowpassFilter` type to integrate the filter in
iterator chains or you can use a convenient function such as
`lowpass_filter` and `lowpass_filter_f64`. The first approach is more
flexible.

### Example with `LowpassFilter` type

See implementation of `lowpass_filter` function.

### Example with `lowpass_filter` function
```rust,no_run
use lowpass_filter::lowpass_filter;

// some samples
let mut mono_audio_data = [0.0, 1.0, -5.0, 1551.0, 141.0, 24.0];
// mutates the input buffer
lowpass_filter(&mut mono_audio_data, 44100.0, 120.0);
```
